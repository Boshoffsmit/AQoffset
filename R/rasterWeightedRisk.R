#' Raster Weighted Risk
#' 
#' Calculate the total weighted risk of an exposure
#' 
#' @details Outcome weights (like disability weights) are used to express different outcomes in 
#' units of one common outcome. In health this is typically death (i.e. morbidity expressed in 
#' mortality terms). What is needed is to have more than one outcome and a weight for each in terms of a 
#' common health outcome. the function works in rasterised fromst.
